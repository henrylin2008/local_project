# Given the Stack class below, implement a Queue class using two stacks! Note, this is a "classic" interview problem. Use a Python list data structure as your Stack.

# In [30]:
# stack1 = []
# stack2 = []


# Solution
# The key insight is that a stack reverses order (while a queue doesn't). A sequence of elements pushed on a stack comes back in reversed order when popped. Consequently, two stacks chained together will return elements in the same order, since reversed order reversed again is original order.

# We use an in-stack that we fill when an element is enqueued and the dequeue operation takes elements from an out-stack. If the out-stack is empty we pop all elements from the in-stack and push them onto the out-stack.

class Queue2Stacks(object):
    
    def __init__(self):
        
        # Two Stacks
        self.instack = []
        self.outstack = []
     
    def enqueue(self,element):
        
        # Add an enqueue with the "IN" stack
        self.instack.append(element)
    
    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.outstack:
            while self.instack:
                # Add the elements to the outstack to reverse the order when called
                self.outstack.append(self.instack.pop())
        return self.outstack.pop()
